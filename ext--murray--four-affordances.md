## A new set of terms
[According to Janet Murray](https://inventingthemedium.com/four-affordances/), author of *Hamlet on the Holodeck* and *Inventing the Medium*,

> Everything made of electronic bits is potentially:
> * **procedural** (composed of executable rules)
> * **participatory** (inviting human action and manipulation of the represented world)
> * **encyclopedic** (containing very high capacity of information in multiple media formats)
> * **spatial** (navigable as an information repository and/or a virtual place)

"These affordances," she writes, "make up the designer’s palette for representation in any digital format or genre."

## Your task:
How well do these *affordances*, i.e. prominent potentialities, line up with the story you wrote for the main activity? In other words: what do they help you see about the digital or the analog objects and habits that you described there? What do you see differently now? What questions do they raise about the changes you narrated? On the flip side: does your story help you understand any of Murray's terms?

**Discuss as a group.** When you're ready, edit this file, and in the section below try to articulate the highlights and main takeaways (including any unanswered questions) from your discussion.

File a pull request back to the main repository when you're done.
